# 9 Best Torrent Downloader Software Tools
Dedicated torrent downloaders for your torrent files

by Paul Gil 

Updated November 15, 2018

You can't just download torrents like you do other types of files. Instead, you need a dedicated torrent downloader — also called a torrent client — a special kind of program that downloads the actual movie and music files that the torrent file is pointing to.

You have two broad choices when it comes to torrent downloading tools: cloud software, which are online services that you subscribe to; and client software, which are programs that you install directly on your computer. Of course, always be sure you're running fully updated anti-malware software before you visit any of these sites.

While cloud software is arguably better at cloaking your P2P habits, both cloud and client software have their advantages. Each offer different prices, levels of control, and customization to suit different tastes.

Below you'll find the most popular torrent downloaders to use with your torrent file sharing. This torrent client list is compiled from hundreds of regular suggestions. Feel free to email us if you have suggestions for this list and if you are using a Chromebook remember things can be different there.

Before you pick a torrent site to download from, make sure you have a solid VPN service running.

## Bitport.io

Bitport.io is an excellent torrent downloader service in the Czech Republic.

This cloud torrent service does not require an install on your computer! Instead, you log into your online account and they will download torrents for you onto their own private servers. Once your large files are transferred to them, you then log on and download the completed file directly to your computer.

The free version allows 1 GB of storage. You can subscribe to get more storage and unlimited transfer speeds.

Bitport is an excellent service, and considering the risks that they incur, the small $5, $10, or $15 monthly fee is an excellent value.

## Tixati

Tixati is a reliable and fast torrent program authored by the architect of the WinMiX OpenNap program.

Displaying a forward-thinking architecture, Tixati embraces the shift towards trackerless torrent swarming, meaning magnet links, PEX, and DHT swarming work very well in Tixati.

The throttling features and range of priority adjustments appeal to fussy P2P users, plus the download speeds are as fast as Vuze and uTorrent.

The bitfield graphs and executive dashboard display are very professional. This product certainly earns a place among the best torrent clients today.

## Transmission (C, open sourced)

If you're a Mac user, Transmission is one of the first torrent downloaders you should try!

This open-source product is designed specifically for Mac so that it achieves the fastest download speeds possible. It's not as feature-rich as some of the other PC-based and Linux-based competitors, but it will definitely meet regular user demands and get your torrent files downloaded quickly.

There is a version for Windows machines, too!

# Deluge (Python, open sourced)

Deluge is open source torrent downloader software that runs on Windows, Linux, and Unix.

This torrent client is built to be a very lightweight product that uses minimal memory and processor power. It offers prioritization features, as well as selective and scheduled downloading, which is invaluable to serious P2P users.

Our readers describe the speeds they get on Deluge as the same or faster than Tixati or BitComet or uTorrent.

## uTorrent

Known as both "u-torrent" and "micro torrent", this is one of the most popular client-based torrent downloader tools out there.

uTorrent has all the functions a great torrent downloader will ever need, and it only requires 1 MB of hard drive space.

uTorrent has all the downloading and seeding performance of its competitors, but with minimal impact on the rest of your computer's speed.

06 of 09
## Tribler (Python, open sourced)

Tribler is special. It is both a torrent client and a built-in search engine for finding torrents on the Web.

If more people use Tribler, this actually circumvents the repeated issue of people's favorite torrent sites being temporarily shut down.

So, if you are very pro-downloading, Tribler actually helps the torrent ecosystem to grow and stay alive.

## Boxopus

Boxopus, like bitport.io, is a cloud-based torrent downloader.

Very conveniently, Boxopus can store your torrents in your Google Drive or Box accounts.

The service does charge $1.50 per week, $14.50 per 3 months, or $50 per year, all USD. While that 7-day price might sound expensive, it's actually very reasonable if you plan your downloads so that you can use the week-long access to its maximum.

08 of 09
## Vuze

You can call it bloatware, or you can call it the Lexus of torrent downloaders! Vuze is a large software product that offers a smorgasbord of features... most of which you may never use.

You can play any media in Vuze, including HD videos. You can play music, and run most any media on this product. Apparently, you can also use Vuze to run media on your iPhone, Xbox, or PSP.

Vuze is very popular, and you'll want to give Vuze a try for a couple days and decide for yourself if this powerful product fits your style of downloading and viewing media.

09 of 09
## BitComet

The BitComet torrent downloader is very good but has lost many users to uTorrent, Transmission, Vuze, and Tixati.

If you are a serious downloader who has particular tastes in interfaces, definitely give BitComet a try. If you are a new user, start with uTorrent or Vuze first.

Many private torrent sites will ban you for using BitComet as there is a pervasive belief that BitComet reports incorrect ratio information, and also leaks data to DHT.
